# Palan Standard Library Reference

**Version:** v0.2.5

The standard library is the library `std`, found with the compiler: `import <std/utf8>;` needs no
`libpath` (see [Using a Library](PalanReference.md#using-a-library) in the
[Palan Language Reference](PalanReference.md)). Its modules are ordinary Palan; nothing in it is
known to the compiler.

## Modules

- [std/utf8](#stdutf8) — UTF-8 text

## std/utf8

```palan
cinclude <stdio.h>;
import <std/utf8>;

utf8 s = "h\u{E9}llo";
s << ", " << "w\u{F6}rld";
s.appendChar('!');
printf("%s %ld %ld\n", s -> cstr(), s -> byteLen(), s -> charCount());   // héllo, wörld! 15 13

for copy c, i in s { printf("%ld:U+%04X ", i, c); }    // -1 for an invalid part

[+]utf8 words = s -> split(", ");
utf8 t = words -> join(" & ");                // héllo & wörld!
if t -> startsWith("h\u{E9}", "H\u{E9}") && t != s { t.replace("&", "+").trim(); }
```

`utf8` is UTF-8 text held with a NUL at the end, so `cstr` gives it to C as it is. A declared
`utf8` is empty. A string literal converts to one wherever a `utf8` is expected
(`utf8 s = "abc";`, `"" -> s;`, `s == "abc"`); other bytes are converted by calling `utf8`.

A character is a Unicode code point: `"🇯🇵"` has 2. Positions (`find`, `slice`, `insert`,
`remove`) count characters, an invalid part counting as one, so reaching one scans the text from
the start (O(n)). A position out of range is brought within it: a negative one is 0, beyond the
end is the end, and a start at or after the end gives nothing.

### Modes

`mode` says what a `utf8` does with bytes that are not valid UTF-8 when text is made or added to
it:

| `utf8mode` | Invalid part |
|------------|--------------|
| `KEEP_INVALID` | kept as it is |
| `REPLACE_INVALID` (the default) | replaced with U+FFFD |
| `DELETE_INVALID` | dropped |

An invalid part is the longest start of a valid sequence, or else one byte, as Unicode
recommends: `"A\xE2\x82B"` has one, which `REPLACE_INVALID` makes `"A\u{FFFD}B"`. Only a
`KEEP_INVALID` text holds invalid bytes. Adding to text takes the added bytes in one call at a
time: a sequence cut at the end of one `<<` is an invalid part even if the next completes it.

`hadInvalid` tells that an invalid part was met in making the text, or in making the texts it was
made from: adding `t` to `s` sets it if `t`'s is set. It is never cleared by adding; `x -> s`
replaces it with `x`'s.

| Text | Mode |
|------|------|
| `utf8 s;`, `utf8 s = "abc";` | `REPLACE_INVALID` |
| `utf8 s = t;`, a move, an argument, a returned value | `t`'s, with `hadInvalid` (the value is copied whole) |
| `t -> s` | `s`'s: `t`'s text is taken in by it. So `utf8 r; s -> r;` is a copy of `s` with each invalid part replaced |
| `s << x`, and every function changing `s` | `s`'s |
| `a + b`, `join` | the loosest of the `utf8` operands' (`KEEP_INVALID`, then `REPLACE_INVALID`, then `DELETE_INVALID`); a string literal or `@[]uint8` operand has none and is taken in by it |
| `slice`, `split` | `s`'s |

A literal given where a function takes `@utf8` (`find`, `replace` and the others) is converted
in `REPLACE_INVALID` mode, so `k -> find("\xFF")` does not find those bytes in a `KEEP_INVALID`
`k`; write `utf8("\xFF", utf8mode.KEEP_INVALID)` to find them. A comparison compares a literal
or `@[]uint8` operand as its bytes.

`s.hadInvalid` and `s.mode` can be read; the bytes are reached only through `cstr`.

### Functions

| Function | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `utf8(@[]uint8 cs, utf8mode m = utf8mode.REPLACE_INVALID) -> utf8` | the NUL-terminated bytes `cs`, made by the rules of `m` |
| `cstr(@utf8 s) -> @[]uint8` | the NUL-terminated bytes, until `s` is changed |
| `byteLen(@utf8 s) -> int64` | the number of bytes, without the NUL |
| `charCount(@utf8 s) -> int64` | the number of characters |
| `for copy c, i in s` | each character `c` as an `int32` code point, `-1` for an invalid part |
| `a == b`, `a < b` (and `!=`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) | by bytes, which is code point order; either one may be a literal or `@[]uint8` |
| `a + b` | `a` then `b`, either one a literal or `@[]uint8` |
| `s << x` | adds `x` (`@utf8`, a literal or `@[]uint8`) and gives `s` back: `s << a << b` |
| `append(@!utf8 s, x) -> @!utf8` | `s << x` |
| `appendChar(@!utf8 s, int32 c) -> @!utf8` | adds the code point `c`; a surrogate, a value beyond U+10FFFF or a negative one is an invalid part, which `KEEP_INVALID` has no bytes to keep for, so it drops it |
| `startsWith(@utf8 s, ...)`, `endsWith`, `contains` | whether `s` starts with, ends with or contains any of the texts given (`s -> startsWith("http:", "https:")`); none given is false, `""` is true |
| `find(@utf8 s, @utf8 x, int64 from = 0) -> int64` | the position of the first `x` at or after `from`, or `-1`; `""` is found at `from` |
| `replace(@!utf8 s, @utf8 from, @utf8 to) -> @!utf8` | replaces every `from`; an empty `from` changes nothing |
| `insert(@!utf8 s, int64 pos, @utf8 x) -> @!utf8` | inserts `x` before the character at `pos` |
| `remove(@!utf8 s, int64 start, int64 end) -> @!utf8` | removes the characters from `start` up to `end` |
| `trim(@!utf8 s) -> @!utf8` | removes the 25 characters of Unicode's White_Space at both ends |
| `slice(@utf8 s, int64 start, int64 end) -> utf8` | the characters from `start` up to `end` |
| `split(@utf8 s, @utf8 sep) -> [+]utf8` | the parts between each `sep`, empty ones included (`"a,,b"` gives `"a"`, `""`, `"b"`); an empty `sep` gives the whole text |
| `join(@[+]utf8 parts, @utf8 sep) -> utf8` | the parts with `sep` between them (`parts -> join(", ")`); no parts give empty text |

The functions changing `s` return it, so they chain: `s.replace("\t", " ").trim();`. `s -> s`
and `s << s` work.

To clear a text write `"" -> s;`; to test for empty text, `s -> byteLen() == 0` or `s == ""`.
